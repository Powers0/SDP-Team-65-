Front End Notes
  Welcome Page
  Drop-down boxes for selecting hitter/batter handedness
  Will be kind of like you're looking through the eyes of the umpire
  Silhouette of batter/pitcher along with a mock strikezone
  Once pitch predict button is hit will play animation of ball coming in or if that is too much the ball will just appear in the zone
  Second phase will have have a button to predict result of the pitch / whether it should be take/swing and miss/ weak contact/ ground out etc. 
Model Notes
  Try to improve accuracy on already existing models
  Train one universal model for all pitcher/batter pairs
  Train a couple more epochs on a specific pitcher/batter pair and see how well it does on predicting the last few years of data 
  Get started on result prediction models
    Separate models for swing/take as opposed to results on contact
  Try to get a super high accuracy by cheating on Owen's model
